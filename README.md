# Hi there folks 👋

🕵️ I'm a fullstack developer based in Barcelona, Spain who fancies coding mostly in Python and JavaScript through modern frameworks like Django and Vue.js. Also a fan of Docker/Docker Swarm and thinking about Kubernetes for my next endeavors 👀 

💌 Here at my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/Endzel) you'll be able to check some of my personal projects. Feel free to reach me anytime here or at my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/endzeldev).

🚀 Currently writing the future at [OneRagtime](https://www.oneragtime.com).
